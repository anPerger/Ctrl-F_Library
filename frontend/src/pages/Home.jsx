                    The Ctrl+F Library helps manage inventory for a network of libraries by tracking details about 100 books including their authors, publishers, genres, across 10 different library locations they are in. Previous iterations of the library storage system were disconnected inventory logs managed individually by each location. This became a huge issue when it came to looking up various details about books and their authors without a unified organizational system that would remain consistent across all libraries. By centralizing all the information and making it consistent for all locations, we hope to make the process of finding books easier and more efficient for users.

                    This updated system replaces an outdated library system with inconsistent logs. Ctrl+F Library ensures real time and accurate book data, which hasnâ€™t previously been offered successfully. There is a constant demand for digital access to collections and this system strives to provide just that.
